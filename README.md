<H1>Privacy Policy for Aqua Pet Paradise Last updated: February 2, 2026</H1>
<p>
<H2>1. Introduction</H2></p>

<p><h4>This privacy policy explains how we collect and process data in the Aqua Pet Paradise mobile game. We value your privacy and limit data collection to the absolute minimum required for the app to function.</h4></p>

<p>
<H2>Data collected directly by the Developer</H2></p>

<p><H4>As the developer, I do not collect, store, or share your personal data (such as name or email). I only see anonymized statistics provided by the Google Play Console (e.g., number of downloads).</H4></p>

<p>
<H2>3. Third-Party Data Collection trzecie</H2></p>

<p><H4>To ensure proper functionality and display ads, the app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify the user:
<ul>
   <li> Google Play Services: (statistics, achievements).</li>

   <li> Ad Providers (e.g., Google AdMob): May collect advertising identifiers (Advertising ID) and device data for ad personalization. </li>

   <li> Development Tools (Lovable.dev): May collect anonymous technical data regarding app stability (crash reports).</li>
</ul>
   
   </H4></p>

<p>
<H2>4. Cookies and Identifier</H2></p>

<p><H4>Advertising libraries may use unique device identifiers to analyze traffic and deliver relevant advertisements. You can manage these settings in the privacy options of your Android device.</H4></p>

<p>
<H2>5. Children's Privacy </H2></p>
<p><H4>Our app is safe for users of all ages. If a user is identified as a child (under 13 or the relevant age in the EU), we automatically limit the use of third-party advertising services. Ads shown to children are non-personalized (they do not collect behavioral data), in compliance with GDPR and COPPA.</H4></p>

<p>
